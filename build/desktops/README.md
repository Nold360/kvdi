# Building kVDI Desktops

This directory contains references/exampls for creating "Desktop" images for `kVDI`.

The examples in this directory are not intended as a "you must do it this way", but moreso just some patterns that can be followed.
That being said, there is some functionality (namely file transfer and audio) that rely on things being setup similarly to these images.

A lot has changed since I first wrote this document, and nothing here was still relevant, so I will be needing to rewrite it.
